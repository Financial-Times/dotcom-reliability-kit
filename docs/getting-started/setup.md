# Getting started: setup

To use Reliability Kit you'll need a few things set up in advance.

  1. A Node.js application (ideally built with either [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or AWS Lambda with [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/), but you should get some benefits even if you're not using these)

  2. For your application to be running on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 16 or above
