# Reliability Kit support

Reliability Kit is owned and maintained by the Customer Products Reliability team at the Financial Times.

It's been designed to make our user-facing systems easier to support in production environments.

However, we hope that it will be useful to other teams at the FT.

## The support we provide

### …within Customer Products

The Reliability team is always available to work with teams in Customer Products. Our priority is making
sure that FT.com, our iOS and Android apps and our Data Journalism work are available to our subscribers.

Please contact us in [#cp-reliability on Slack](https://financialtimes.slack.com/archives/C02B89GEQHF) with
any bug reports, feature ideas or requests for collaboration.

### …to other teams at the FT

Where time allows, we would love to improve Reliability Kit so that it better meets the needs of other
users at the FT. This could include:

- reviewing minor code changes that will make these packages work better for you
- meeting with you to discuss features that you would like to add
- pairing with you on implementing larger features

### …to users outside the FT

Unfortunately we're unable to offer any guarantees of support to users outside the FT.
