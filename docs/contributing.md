## Requirements

In order to contribute and make changes to this repository, you'll need some software installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev) on a version defined in `package.json`: `engines.node`

  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) on a version defined in `package.json`: `engines.npm` (usually bundled with Node.js)

### Optional

The following software will make your life easier when making changes to Reliability Kit:

  * [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) can manage your Node.js and npm versions automatically


## Getting set up

To set up this repo to make changes locally, make sure you have all of the [required software](#requirements), then:

  * Clone this repo and `cd` into it
  * Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * Run `npm test` to verify that everything's working


## Creating a new package

To create a new package in this repo, run the following command. This will bootstrap the package files and make sure it's added to the [release configuration](#releasing) and is auto-versioned correctly.

The name of the package must be lowercase with words hyphen-delimited.

```
npm run create-package <NAME>
```

You'll need to manually add the package to the list of packages in the README once it's ready to be used by other teams.

You'll also need to manually add an entry for the package to [the Dependabot config](../.github/dependabot.yml) so that dependency update pull requests can be opened.


## Installing dependencies

Because we use a monorepo managed with [npm workspaces](./design.md#monorepo-management), installing dependencies is slightly different to other projects. You'll need to adjust the way you install dependencies as follows. If you're reviewing a pull request on Reliability Kit, then please also check that dependencies have been installed in the expected places.

### Repo-wide dependencies

The top level `package.json` file should _never_ include any dependencies apart from `devDependencies`. If you install the dependencies that individual packages rely on here then they will not have access to them after publishing.

If you need a new development dependency that is used across the whole repository, then you can install it as normal by running the following from the repo base path:

```
npm install --save-dev <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
```

### Package dependencies

If a specific package relies on a new dependency, then you **must not** `cd` into the package and run an `npm install`. This will end up creating a `package-lock.json` file within that folder and cause all sorts of dependency issues. Instead, you must use the `--workspace` flag, setting it to the package you want to install a dependency in:

```
npm install --workspace=packages/<PACKAGE_NAME> <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
```

This ensures that we continue to maintain a single `package-lock.json` file in the root of the repo.

Some packages may also require their own specific development dependencies, for example `@types` packages or specific modules required for testing that package alone. This can be done with the `--workspace` flag too:

```
npm install --save-dev --workspace=packages/<PACKAGE_NAME> <DEPENDENCY_NAME>
```

### Depending on other Reliability Kit packages

If a package within Reliability Kit relies on _another_ Reliability Kit package, you'll still need to codify this relationship in the `package.json` file for the dependent package. You can do this normally with an `npm install`, using the full `@dotcom-reliability-kit/<NAME>` package name. For example if your package relies on the internal `errors` package then you'd run this:

```
npm install --workspace=packages/<PACKAGE_NAME> @dotcom-reliability-kit/errors
```


## Testing

Reliability Kit includes some tooling to ensure that code quality and consistency is high.

### Linters

JavaScript files are expected to pass the linting rules defined by the project ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). We attempt to run the linters on every commit, but you can also check lint errors manually either by installing the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) or by running the following locally:

```
npm run lint
```

The linters are also run on pull requests and linting errors will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.

### Type safety

We do not write TypeScript in this project, but we _do_ write [thorough JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) and test against it which gives us all the benefits of TypeScript ([more info](./design.md#languages)).

We do not compile the code in our packages, but we do check that all variables are set to the correct types. If there are any type errors then you should see these in your editor if you're using VS Code. Otherwise type checking can be manually run as part of linting:

```
npm run lint
```

As with ESLint, we check types in pull requests and errors will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.

### Unit tests

We run unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and aim for [100% coverage](#coverage). Tests are written within each package (e.g. `packages/example/test/example.spec.js`) and are run in parallel. You can run the tests with the following:

```
npm run test
```

Tests are also run on pull requests and failing tests will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.

#### Coverage

We intentionally fail the unit tests if coverage drops below 100%. This library is meant to help our applications be more reliable and so it's important that we cover as many edge cases as possible. If you have a valid reason for some code not to be covered, e.g. an empty function as a default parameter, then [use code comments to disable coverage](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul/blob/master/ignoring-code-for-coverage.md) for that line or block:

```js
/* istanbul ignore next */
function example() { console.log('this is not covered'); }
```

This is better than dropping the required coverage because:

  * We have to make an active and conscious decision to drop a piece of code below 100% coverage

  * The fact that code isn't covered is _documented_ in the code

  * It opens up discussion in the pull request when we see an uncovered piece of code â€“ maybe the reviewer will have some useful ideas about how to make it possible to cover


## Committing

We require commit messages to be written using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This is how our [automated release system](#releasing) knows what a given commit means.

```
<type>: <description>

[body]
```

### Commit type prefixes

The `type` can be any of `feat`, `fix`, `docs` or `chore`.

The prefix is used to calculate the semver release level:

| **type**  | when to use                                            | release level |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| feat      | a feature has been added                               | `minor`       |
| fix       | a bug has been patched                                 | `patch`       |
| docs      | a change to documentation                              | `patch`       |
| chore     | repo maintenance and support tasks                     | none          |

Indicate a breaking change by placing an `!` between the type name and the colon, e.g.

```
feat!: add a breaking feature
```

### Commit linting

We use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce standard commit messages. If you're reviewing pull requests in this project then be sure to check that all commit messages conform anyway.

### Pull request scope

Because of the way [our release process](#releasing) works (as well as smaller focused PRs being easier to understand and review) it's important to consider the scope of the changes in your PR. When calculating the next version bump for a package, Release Please will look at all the files in the pull request rather than just the files related to the individual commits. This can cause unwanted version bumps, e.g. a `docs` changes in the root of the repo can end up creating extra `patch` releases of packages that aren't actually impacted by it.

This makes it important to consider whether the changes you're making outside of the `packages` folder really belong in the same PR as changes to packages. If you're making broad changes to the repo this can result in unnecessary version bumps for packages if you use anything other than a `chore` commit for them.

If superflous releases are generated after merging a PR, [it's possible to fix it](#correcting-releases).


### Merging pull requests

In order to preserve conventional commits, pull requests must be merged or rebased rather than squashed. This is enforced in the repo.


## Releasing

Our releases are managed by [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please#readme).

When a commit with the `feat` or `fix` [commit type prefix](#commit-type-prefixes) or a breaking change (`!`) reaches the `main` branch, a pull request will be opened with a name matching something like `chore: release main`. Merging this pull request will automatically create GitHub releases for each package as well as publishing the new package versions to npm.

If the PR is left alone, it will continue to be updated with new releases as more commits appear on the `main` branch.

Before approving and merging the release PR, make sure you review it. You need to check the package versions that it updates to make sure youâ€™re only releasing the things you expect.

### Generated files

Before publishing npm packages we do generate TypeScript type declaration files (`.d.ts`) so that TypeScript-based project which use Reliability Kit will get correct type hinting.

If a release has caused issues with Type hinting or TypeScript-based projects compiling, then you can inspect the generated files by running the build command locally and viewing the `.d.ts` files in your editor:

```
npm run build
```

### Correcting releases

Sometimes the releases that Release Please decides to create may be incorrect, because of the way it bumps packages for _all_ changed files in a PR. Considering [pull request scope](#pull-request-scope) is important, but sometimes it's unavoidable that some additional changes sneak in. In this case it's possible to change the releases that an already-merged PR will create.

[Update the PR description with a special override to correct the release type](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please/blob/main/README.md#how-can-i-fix-release-notes) and re-run the Release Please command locally:

```
npx release-please release-pr --token="XXXXXX" --repo-url="Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit"
```

In this command, change `XXXXXX` to a GitHub token with write access to the Reliability Kit repo. This can be a personal or bot token, but it's best to use the one defined in the [Dotcom Reliability Kit vault](https://vault.in.ft.com:8080/ui/vault/secrets/secret/show/teams/next/dotcom-reliability-kit/continuous-integration) as `RELEASE_PLEASE_GITHUB_TOKEN`.

[There's an example of a PR which we did this for here](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit/pull/116).
