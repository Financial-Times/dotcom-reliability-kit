## Requirements

In order to contribute and make changes to this repository, you'll need some software installed:

  * [Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/) v14 or higher

  * [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v7 or higher (usually bundled with Node.js)

### Optional

The following software will make your life easier when making changes to Reliability Kit:

  * [Volta](https://docs.volta.sh/guide/getting-started) can manage your Node.js and npm versions automatically


## Getting set up

To set up this repo to make changes locally, make sure you have all of the [required software](#requirements), then:

  * Clone this repo and `cd` into it
  * Run `npm install` to install dependencies
  * Run `npm test` to verify that everything's working


## Testing

Reliability Kit includes some tooling to ensure that code quality and consistency is high.

### Linters

JavaScript files are expected to pass the linting rules defined by the project ([ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)). We attempt to run the linters on every commit, but you can also check lint errors manually either by installing the [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) or by running the following locally:

```
npm run lint
```

The linters are also run on pull requests and linting errors will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.

### Type safety

We do not write TypeScript in this project, but we _do_ write [thorough JSDoc](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) and test against it which gives us all the benefits of TypeScript ([more info](./design.md#languages)).

We do not compile the code in our packages, but we do check that all variables are set to the correct types. If there are any type errors then you should see these in your editor if you're using VS Code. Otherwise type checking can be manually run as part of linting:

```
npm run lint
```

As with ESLint, we check types in pull requests and errors will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.

### Unit tests

We run unit tests with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and aim for ~100% coverage. This library is meant to help our applications be more reliable and so it's important that we cover as many edge cases as possible. Tests are written within each package (e.g. `packages/example/test/example.spec.js`) and are run in parallel. You can run the tests with the following:

```
npm run test
```

Tests are also run on pull requests and failing tests will block merging, so it's useful to check before opening a PR.


## Committing

We require commit messages to be written using [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This is how our [automated release system](#releasing) knows what a given commit means.

```
<type>: <description>

[body]
```

### Commit type prefixes

The `type` can be any of `feat`, `fix`, `docs` or `chore`.

The prefix is used to calculate the semver release level:

| **type**  | when to use                                            | release level |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| feat      | a feature has been added                               | `minor`       |
| fix       | a bug has been patched                                 | `patch`       |
| docs      | a change to documentation                              | none          |
| chore     | any changes that don't impact end users of the library | none          |

Indicate a breaking change by placing an `!` between the type name and the colon, e.g.

```
feat!: add a breaking feature
```

or

```
chore!: drop support for Node.js v12
```

### Commit linting

We use [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce standard commit messages. If you're reviewing pull requests in this project then be sure to check that all commit messages conform anyway.

### Merging pull requests

In order to preserve conventional commits, pull requests must be merged or rebased rather than squashed. This is enforced in the repo.


## Releasing

Our releases are managed by [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please#readme).

When a commit with the `feat` or `fix` [commit type prefix](#commit-type-prefixes) or a breaking change (`!`) reaches the `main` branch, a pull request will be opened with a name matching something like `chore: release main`. Merging this pull request will automatically create GitHub releases for each package as well as publishing the new package versions to npm.

If the PR is left alone, it will continue to be updated with new releases as more commits appear on the `main` branch.

Before approving and merging the release PR, make sure you review it. You need to check the package versions that it updates to make sure youâ€™re only releasing the things you expect.
