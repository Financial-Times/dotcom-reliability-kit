A utility to get application information (e.g. the system code) in a consistent way. This module is part of [FT.com Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit#readme).

## Usage

Install `@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info` as a dependency:

```bash
npm install --save @dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info
```

Include in your code:

```js
import appInfo from '@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info';
// or
const appInfo = require('@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info');
```

The `appInfo` object has several properties which can be used to access application information.

### `appInfo.commitHash`

Get the commit hash that the application last deployed. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT`, `process.env.GIT_COMMIT_LONG`, or `process.env.GIT_COMMIT` is defined) or `null` otherwise.

For Heroku, this relies on the [Dyno Metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

For AWS Lambda, you can use a plugin like [serverless-plugin-git-variables](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serverless-plugin-git-variables) to provide this data or set the `GIT_COMMIT` environment variable during deployment.

### `appInfo.environment`

Get the application environment, normally either `development` or `production`. This will be a string, using `process.env.NODE_ENV` and defaulting to `development`.

### `appInfo.region`

Get the region that the application is running in. This will be a string (if `process.env.REGION` or `process.env.AWS_REGION` is defined) or `null` otherwise.

### `appInfo.releaseDate`

Get the application Heroku release date. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_RELEASE_CREATED_AT` is defined) or `null` otherwise.

For Heroku, this relies on the [Dyno Metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

### `appInfo.releaseVersion`

Get the application Heroku release version. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_RELEASE_VERSION` or `process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_VERSION` is defined) or `null` otherwise.

For Heroku, this relies on the [Dyno Metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

### `appInfo.systemCode`

Get the application's [Biz Ops](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/) system code. This will be a string (if `process.env.SYSTEM_CODE` is defined), if not then it will be read from the `name` property of `$CWD/package.json`, if neither of these exist then it will be set to `null`.

If the system code is read from the application's `package.json` file then it will be stripped of any `"ft-"` prefix â€“ this is a legacy name and our app system codes do not begin with it.

### `appInfo.processType`

Get the type of the running process, which is the name for the current process within an application.

For AWS Lambda, this is the name of the function, read from `process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME`.

For Heroku, this is derived from the first part of `process.env.DYNO`, which is set to by Heroku, e.g. a dyno called `web.1` will have `processType` set to `web`. The process types in an application are defined by the application's `Procfile`.

If neither `process.env.AWS_LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME` or `process.env.DYNO` are set, this property will be `null`

### `appInfo.cloudProvider`

Get the type of cloud provider which is set to either Heroku or AWS depending on where we think the system is hosted.

This is derived from some environment variables which we have high confidence are defined by only Heroku or AWS/Lambda

### `appInfo.herokuAppId`

Get the `process.env.HEROKU_APP_ID` which is the unique identifier for the application.e.g "9daa2797-e49b-4624-932f-ec3f9688e3da"

This is derived from the dyno metadata

### `appInfo.herokuDynoId`

Get the `process.env.HEROKU_DYNO_ID` which is the dyno identifier

This is derived from the dyno metadata

### `appInfo.instanceId`

Get the ID of the instance that's running the application. This is derived from `process.env.HEROKU_DYNO_ID` if present, otherwise it will be set to a random UUID that identifies the currently running process.

### `appInfo.semanticConventions`

This object contains aliases for the main `appInfo` properties that correspond to OpenTelemetry's [Semantic Conventions](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/semantic-conventions/). We use the following mapping:

  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.cloud.provider` aliases `appInfo.cloudProvider`
  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.cloud.region` aliases `appInfo.region`
  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.deployment.environment` aliases `appInfo.environment`
  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.service.name` aliases `appInfo.systemCode`
  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.service.version` aliases `appInfo.releaseVersion`
  * `appInfo.semanticConventions.service.instance.id` aliases `appInfo.instanceId`
