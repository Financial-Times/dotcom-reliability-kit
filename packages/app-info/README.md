A utility to get application information (e.g. the system code) in a consistent way. This module is part of [FT.com Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit#readme).

## Usage

Install `@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info` as a dependency:

```bash
npm install --save @dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info
```

Include in your code:

```js
import appInfo from '@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info';
// or
const appInfo = require('@dotcom-reliability-kit/app-info');
```

The `appInfo` object has several properties which can be used to access application information.

### `appInfo.commitHash`

Get the commit hash that the application last deployed. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_SLUG_COMMIT` is defined) or `null` otherwise. This relies on the [Heroku Dyno metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

### `appInfo.environment`

Get the application environment, normally either `development` or `production`. This will be a string, using `process.env.NODE_ENV` and defaulting to `development`.

### `appInfo.region`

Get the application Heroku region. This will be a string (if `process.env.REGION` is defined) or `null` otherwise.

### `appInfo.releaseDate`

Get the application Heroku release date. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_RELEASE_CREATED_AT` is defined) or `null` otherwise. This relies on the [Heroku Dyno metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

### `appInfo.releaseVersion`

Get the application Heroku release version. This will be a string (if `process.env.HEROKU_RELEASE_VERSION` is defined) or `null` otherwise. This relies on the [Heroku Dyno metadata labs feature](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/dyno-metadata) and will not be present in local development.

### `appInfo.systemCode`

Get the application's [Biz Ops](https://biz-ops.in.ft.com/) system code. This will be a string (if `process.env.SYSTEM_CODE` is defined), if not then it will be read from the `name` property of `$CWD/package.json`, if neither of these exist then it will be set to `null`.

If the system code is read from the application's `package.json` file then it will be stripped of any `"ft-"` prefix â€“ this is a legacy name and our app system codes do not begin with it.
