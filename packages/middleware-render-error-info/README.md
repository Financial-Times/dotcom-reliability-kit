## @dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-render-error-info

Express middleware to render error information in a browser in a way that makes local debugging easier and production error rendering more consistent. This module is part of [FT.com Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit#readme).

## Usage

Install `@dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-render-error-info` as a dependency:

```bash
npm install --save @dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-render-error-info
```

Include in your code:

```js
import renderErrorInfoPage from '@dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-render-error-info';
// or
const renderErrorInfoPage = require('@dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-render-error-info');
```

### `renderErrorInfoPage`

The `renderErrorInfoPage` function can be used to generate Express middleware which renders an error debugging page in local development and a sensible stripped-back error page in production.

When the `NODE_ENV` environment variable is either **empty** or set to **`"development"`** then a full debug page will be rendered. Otherwise only the error status code and message will be output, e.g. `500 Server Error`. This ensures that we don't leak important error information in production.

> [!CAUTION]<br />
> This middleware **must** be added to your Express app _after_ all your application routes â€“ you won't get rendered errors for any routes which are mounted after this middleware.

```js
const app = express();
// App routes go here
app.use(renderErrorInfoPage());
```

> [!CAUTION]<br />
> If you're using [@dotcom-reliability-kit/middleware-log-errors](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit/tree/main/packages/middleware-log-errors#readme) in your app, it's best to mount the error page middleware _after_ the logging middleware. Otherwise the error will never be logged.

Once you've mounted the middleware, if you're working locally you should now see a detailed error page when you encounter an error in your app (assuming you're [relying on the Express error handler to serve errors](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit/blob/main/docs/getting-started/handling-errors.md#bubbling-up-in-express)):

#### Debug headers

As well as rendering an error page, the middleware also sends an `error-fingerprint` HTTP header in the response. This contains the [error fingerprint](../serialize-error/README.md#serializederrorfingerprint) and is available in development and production. Inspecting this header on a generic error page can help identify the root cause of an issue.
