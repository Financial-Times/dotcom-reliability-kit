## Reliability Kit Express Example

This is an example Express application which illustrates how to use [FT.com Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit#readme).

Most of the code for this example app is in [`app.js`](./app.js). It's important to remember that this app isn't an example of how to correctly set up a Financial Times Express application â€“ it's used to illustrate how to integrate Reliability Kit into an express app with as little boilerplate code as possible.

You can run the application with the following:

```
npm start
```

Or the following if running from the root of this monorepo:

```
npm start -w examples/express
```
