## Usage

This package includes JSON files which can be used to create Splunk dashboards. The following dashboard templates are available:

  * **[Heroku](./src/heroku.json):** A dashboard to view issues with apps which use Reliability Kit and Heroku Log Drains. This template includes an input to set system code, so there's no need to create your own copy of this dashboard â€“ just use the [live dashboard](https://financialtimes.splunkcloud.com/en-US/app/search/reliability_kit_heroku) and change the system code.


## Contributing

See the [central contributing guide for Reliability Kit](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-reliability-kit/blob/main/docs/contributing.md) for the basics. There are also some additional requirements for working with Splunk dashboards.

If you make edits using the Splunk UI, make sure that only the changes you require are actually pasted back into this repo. This includes making sure that you don't accidentally break data source linking etc. It's a good idea to rename the IDs that the Splunk UI generates so that it's easier to see what the dashboard is doing.
